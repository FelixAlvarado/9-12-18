Given two trings and operations (insert, remove, replace), find minimm number of eidts to turn str1 to str2. 

1. If last characters the same, do nothing and recur call m-1 and n-1. 
2. Else, consider all 3 operations, return 1 + min numbers of the following 
a. Insert: recur for m and n-1 
b. Remove: recur for m-1 and n 
c. replace: recur for m-1 and n-1 

Explain the difference btween controlled and uncontrolled components 

controlled componenets maintain their own sate (this.state, setState) as with used for form data with onChange. the componenet keeps its form data 
with uncontrolled componeents, form data is handled by the dom.  you would use .createRef() to get data from an input element when the data is needed
