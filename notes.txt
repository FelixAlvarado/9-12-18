Explain the edit distance algorithm 

Given two trings and operations (insert, remove, replace), find minimm number of eidts to turn str1 to str2. 

1. If last characters the same, do nothing and recur call m-1 and n-1. 
2. Else, consider all 3 operations, return 1 + min numbers of the following 
a. Insert: recur for m and n-1 
b. Remove: recur for m-1 and n 
c. replace: recur for m-1 and n-1
